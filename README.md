## About this project

*Have trouble with deleting custom url from bit.ly?*

*Wanna get a reserved custom url before your to-custom url exist?*

> **This is [sulai.pw](http://sulai.pw)**

**Note**: 
* The site is temporarily **shut down** due to inactivity (and *GCP's expensive CloudSQL* :sob:)
* Demo video can be found **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR-pavYH4ko)**
* The webpages to this date hasn't been very responsive for mobile view, as the main container still too big (need x-scroll)

This is another url shortener, but with added capabilities. First released on 6th July 2020, for my CS50x final project. This website is hosted at
**[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)**, was built with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) (+ Jinja & Werkzeug), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/),
[Hashids](https://hashids.org/python/), and (of course) HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Javascript.

## How to Use

Straight from [sulai.pw](https://sulai.pw), you can shorten your url without logging in. You are then redirected to show your
all shorten links. However, without logged in, you can only shorten up to 5 URLs. You can delete it and create again, but you
can't customize or reserve a link.

To login, go straight to the navigation bar and there it is. For now, I haven't think of using email verification, so
registering to it is really easy. After that, you will be redirected to dashboard and you can see there are "Create" and
"Reserve" menu. To customize an existing link, you can do that in dashboard, choose the "Action" column.

## That's it, thanks! :blush:
